# TheHackerPlaybook

Contains scripts and info related to my journey through "The Hacker Playbook" by Peter Kim

The first script in the collection is InstallPlaybookTools.sh. This script will install the tools listed in the "Setting Up Kali" section (p 6-13) and have been adjusted and tested on Kali Linux 2.0. Feel free to use and make an suggestions for improvements. I put this together so that I can easily install the tools on multiple machines or quickly re-install on a horked machine. Enjoy!
